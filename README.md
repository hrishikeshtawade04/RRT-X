# Overview

- The code was initially written in the Julia language (http://julialang.org/) by Professor Michael Otte. 
- Sharan Nayak worked on making it compatible to newer Julia versions (https://gitlab.com/Otte-Lab) 

This repository contains the C++ version of the code developed by me. The goal is to create ROS package for RRTX
and implement on a turtlebot or create visualizations on MATLAB.
